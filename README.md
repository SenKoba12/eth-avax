# eth-avax 

This is the assessment for ETH + AVAX for Metacrafters using Solidity.

## Description

Your task is to create a ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should have the following functionality:

Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.
Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.
